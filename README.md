The code provided is designed to benchmark and compare the performance of two different matrix addition algorithms, referred to as "Version 1" and "Version 2." The primary purpose is to measure the execution times of these two implementations for various matrix sizes.

**Matrix Addition:** Both versions of the code perform matrix addition, a fundamental mathematical operation that adds two matrices element-wise. In this case, matrices A and B are added together to produce matrix C.

**Performance Evaluation:** The code utilizes the <chrono> library to precisely measure the time it takes for each version of the matrix addition algorithm to complete. By doing so, it assesses and compares the computational efficiency of the two implementations.

**Iterative Testing:** The code iterates through a range of matrix sizes, specified in the n_values vector. It conducts performance tests for each matrix size to observe how execution time scales with matrix dimensions.

**Comparison:** The primary goal is to compare the execution times of "Version 1" and "Version 2" of the matrix addition algorithm. These versions differ in the order in which they traverse the matrices (row-major vs. column-major), which can impact performance due to cache considerations.

**Informative Output:** The code generates informative output, displaying the matrix size (n) and the execution times for both versions. This allows users to analyze and understand the relative efficiency of the two implementations.
